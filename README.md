### üåæ Wheat Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting wheat crop diseases using state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures.
It leverages transfer learning with models such as ResNet50V2, ConvNeXt, and EfficientNetV2 to achieve high accuracy while maintaining efficiency on large datasets.

### üß† Project Overview

The model classifies wheat leaf images into 15 categories (disease and healthy classes).
A large dataset (~13k images) is used for training, validation, and testing.
The pipeline is optimized for Google Colab GPU environments with:
- Frozen base layers for faster fine-tuning
- Mixed precision training (AMP) for better speed and memory efficiency
- Learning rate scheduling and early stopping
- Automatic best model checkpointing

###  üß† Model Performance

Our current CNN-based Wheat Disease Detection model achieves **~80% accuracy** on a large dataset of over **13,000 images**,  
**without any hyperparameter tuning or optimization.**

Due to limited GPU resources, this version focuses on **demonstrating feasibility and efficiency**, not peak performance.  

If selected for further development, we plan to:
- Apply **advanced hyperparameter tuning**
- Add **data augmentation & balancing**
- Use **model pruning/quantization** for faster inference
- Optimize for **real-time production deployment**

> ‚ö° *Even without optimization, our model achieves around 80% accuracy ‚Äî showcasing its strong potential for scalable agricultural AI solutions.*
